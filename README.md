# ⚛️ **React Experiments: A Trail of Broken Code and Shattered Dreams**  

**Welcome to my React graveyard**, where components go to die and hooks haunt my nightmares. This repo is a chaotic museum of:  

- **"It worked on my machine"** moments  
- **Over-engineered counters** (because one wasn’t enough)  
- **State management disasters** (Redux? Context? Zustand? Just throw it all in)  
- **`useEffect` dependencies** that somehow still fire infinitely  
- **"Why is this re-rendering?!"** screams into the void  

### �‍♂️ **What You’ll Find Here**  
- **Tutorial code I forgot to delete** (but now it’s "reference material")  
- **Half-baked hooks** that *might* work if you squint  
- **Bold attempts at optimization** (followed by `memo()` misuse)  
- **Components so abstract** even I don’t know what they do anymore  
- **Comments like "FIX THIS LATER"** from 6 months ago  

### 🚨 **Disclaimer**  
- **No guarantees** these examples won’t crash your browser.  
- **Best viewed with** a cup of coffee and low expectations.  
- **If it works**, it’s probably accidental.  

```jsx
// How most of these files end:
export default function WhyDidIDoThis() {
  return <div>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</div>;
}
```  

**Star ⭐ if you too have cried over React hydration errors.**
